### Objectives:

The main goal of this series of tasks is to understand the basics of working with the **Node.js** platform.
You are offered to complete a series of small tasks with a gradual increase in complexity. The final touch will be the creation of a small application for building a static website.

Please note that most tasks can be accomplished in multiple ways, and at this stage, there are no incorrect approaches. Only the functionality of your code and adherence to the specified conditions will be evaluated.
