### Objectives:

The main goal of this series of tasks is to understand the basics of working with the **Node.js** platform.
You are offered to complete a series of small tasks with a gradual increase in complexity. The final touch will be the creation of a small application for building a static website.

Please note that most tasks can be accomplished in multiple ways, and at this stage, there are no incorrect approaches. Only the functionality of your code and adherence to the specified conditions will be evaluated.

### General Rules

- The use of any third-party modules is strictly prohibited.
- Each task must be executed <u>in the root directory</u> using the command `node <task folder name>`.
- Utilizing synchronous functions from the **fs module**, such as `fs.statSync(path[, options])`, `fs.readFileSync(path[, options])`, and others found in the [Synchronous API section](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_synchronous_api), is not allowed.
- The use of the `setTimeout()` function is forbidden.
- Task execution and verification should be carried out on the **LTS** version of Node.
